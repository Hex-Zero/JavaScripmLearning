          <h3 class="question">What is JavaScript?</h3>
          <h5 class="answer">
            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
            implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
            more than just sit there and display static information for you to
            look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
            animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can
            bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

          <h3 class="question">What is a variable?</h3>
          <h4 class="answer">
            Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables
            which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime. JavaScript
            uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must
            have a unique name.

          <h3 class="question">what is a javascript library?</h3>
          <h4 class="answer">
            In JavaScript, the way we do that is by using a library. A library
            is a JavaScript file that contains a bunch of functions, and those
            functions accomplish some useful task for your webpage.

          <h3 class="question">What are Methods?</h3>
          <h5 class="answer">
            Methods are JavaScript functions that belong to objects. Methods
            differ from functions in that methods are always associated and used
            with a particular object. isNaN() is an example of a JavaScript
            function. – Tests for “not a number”; if value = 0 (false), value is
            a number

          <h3 class="question">What are Events?</h3>
          <h4 class="answer">
            Events are actions that trigger other actions to occur. • An event
            handler is an optional script that handles input received in a
            program. Handlers are JavaScript code inside the html tags (rather
            than the script tags) that execute other JavaScript code in response
            to an event.

          <h3 class="question">What is loading order?</h3>
          <h4 class="answer">
            the browser will fetch and execute the script right away, and wait
            for it to finish, before loading any HTML that appear after the
            script tag. This means: If your JavaScript is slow, user will see
            the browser freeze, showing no content after the script, until the
            script execution is finished.

          <h3 class="question">What is Recursion?</h3>
          <h3 class="answer">
            Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls
            itself.
